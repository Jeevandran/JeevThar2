	 <h2>
	 	Sarawak on Borneo Island is the largest state in Malaysia. Dense and almost impenetrable jungle covers its vast interior, interspersed with caves and national parks. Long coasts stretch across the South China Sea housing small cities, including Kuching, Sibu and Miri. Travellers usually start in Kuching, affectionately called ‘City of Cats’. Check out the Kuching Waterfront, Astana (Palace) and Carpenter Street. Culture Trip recommends all travellers visit Bako National Park, where tame proboscis monkeys, endemic to Borneo, watch curiously near Park HQ. If you have more time, head to Sarawak’s nationwide famous caves. Niah National Park near Miri is the most accessible.
