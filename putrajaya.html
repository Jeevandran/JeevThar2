	<h1>Wonders Of Putrajaya</h1>

	 <h2>
	 	The administrative capital of Malaysia lies 30 kilometres (18.6 miles) south of Kuala Lumpur and showcases the country’s most elegant architecture. People often confuse Putrajaya as an extension of Kuala Lumpur since the two territories seamlessly blend into one another, but there are many differences between each spot. Stately government offices cluster around Central Core District. The pink-domed Putra Mosque dominates the skyline with a soaring minaret that is 116 metres (381 feet) tall. Colossal Seri Perdana (the prime minister’s official residence) blends both Malay and Islamic styles with European neoclassical columns. Putrajaya also hosts a sprawling botanical garden and the futuristic Seri Wawasan cable bridge.
