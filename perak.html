	 <h2>
	 	Perak is one of the most criminally underrated states in Malaysia, hiding limestone cliffs and mysterious cave temples within its reach. The cities of Ipoh and Taiping both boast stunning architecture and a thriving food scene. Culture Trip recommends spending two nights in Ipoh, where you can explore the Ipoh Heritage Trail, visit cave temples and discover Neolithic cave art. The half-finished and haunting Kellie’s Castle sits in nearby Batu Gajah. Former tin-mining Taiping on the other hand is entirely off the tourist trail (for now), but the little-known city features English-style Lake Gardens, Taiping Zoo (with orangutans) and dramatic mountains. Culture Trip also recommends exploring Pangkor Island’s quiet beaches and Malaysia’s very own Leaning Tower of Teluk Intan.
