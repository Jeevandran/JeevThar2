	<h1>Wonders Of Sabah</h1>

	 <h2>
	 	Borneo’s Sabah in East Malaysia showcases the best of Malaysia’s biodiversity. Pre-historic rainforest covers most of the state, where endemic proboscis monkeys and orangutans swing from the trees. Mount Kinabalu at 4,095 metres (13,435 feet) stands proudly as Malaysia’s tallest peak, with most travellers arriving at Kota Kinabalu (literally Kinabalu City) as a base for scaling this beast. Speedboats connect the city with Tunku Abdul Rahman Marine Park’s beach and snorkelling opportunities within minutes. Take a day trip to the northernmost ‘Tip of Borneo’ in Kudat and watch the fireflies in Kota Belud. If you want the jungle, spend a few nights in Danum Valley or the rarely explored Maliau Basin.
