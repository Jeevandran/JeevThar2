	 <h2>
	 Malacca oozes with history and culture, with a celebrated title as one of the most historically important states in Malaysia. Malacca’s 15th-century Sultanate led to the modern Malay identity, accepting three eras of colonial influence (Portuguese, Dutch and British influence) that spanned almost five centuries. Today, UNESCO-listed Malacca City bursts with centuries-old structures, including St Paul’s—Malaysia’s oldest church. It also has a thriving food scene: Many people come here solely to eat their way through Jonker Street and stuff their faces with mountains of Peranakan cuisine.
