	<h1>Wonders Of Perlis</h1>

	 <h2>
	 	The smallest and northernmost state in Malaysia hardly gets any visitors. The Malay-Thai border sits about 40 kilometres (25 miles) north of tiny state capital Kangar. But despite its size and tourists’ lack of interest, Perlis packs an intriguing punch: A raja, not a sultan, rules over Perlis. This fascinating technicality dates back to the 19th century, when Perlis became part of Siam, which instated a king. Despite the Malay royal bloodline, the king became a raja because another sultan didn’t explicitly bestow him. Spend two days in Perlis, where Culture Trip recommends visiting the Arau (royal capital) and Masjid Terapung Al-Hussain floating mosque. Limestone caves penetrate many of the surrounding hills, offering countless spelunking opportunities with guided tours.
