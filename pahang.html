	 <h2>
	 	Pahang is among the more diverse states in Malaysia, offering highlands, beaches and islands. Cameron Highlands sits at approximately 1,200 metres (3,937 feet) above sea level. Temperatures hover in the low 20s (Celsius) and high 60s or low 70s (Fahrenheit), with terraced tea plantations sprawling across the forested mountains. Visitors can hike to waterfalls, pick strawberries and indulge in English-style afternoon tea. Head a little deeper into Pahang to Taman Negara (National Park). This 130-million-year-old rainforest features the world’s longest canopy walk and Mount Tahan (West Malaysia’s tallest and toughest peak). Click here to find out how to travel to Taman Negara. Beach-lovers can escape the tourists along state capital Kuantan’s east coast resorts, or travel to the palm-fringed, white-sand Tioman Island for a romantic getaway.
